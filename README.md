# Pokémon Reborn Access

V0.2

## Description

This is a mod to further enhance accessibility for blind players in the Pokémon Reborn game, designed to be played alongside the "blindstep" password. The mod is originally a fork of Malta 10's pathfinding mod, and DemICE's distance gauge mod.

Confirmed working with game version 19.5.26 on Windows and the NVDA screen reader: <https://www.nvaccess.org/download/>.

I will always try to keep the mod updated to work with the last game version, but feedback about other platforms or game versions is welcome and encouraged!

## Contents

- Pathfinding Mod.
- Distance gauge mod.

## Controls

- Press **F6** to activate pathfinding.
- Hold **Alt** + arrow key to use the distance gauge.
