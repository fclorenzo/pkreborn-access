# Pokémon Reborn Access

V2.0.0

## Description

This is a mod to further enhance accessibility for blind players in the Pokémon Reborn game, designed to be played alongside the "blindstep" password. The mod is originally a fork of Malta 10's pathfinding mod.

Confirmed working with game version 19.6 on Windows and the NVDA screen reader: <https://www.nvaccess.org/download/>.

I will always try to keep the mod updated to work with the latest game version, but feedback about other platforms or game versions is welcome and encouraged!

## Contents

- Pathfinding Mod.

## Controls

- **F6**: scan the current map's events (use this when you enter a new map or the map's events change).
- **J, K and L**: anounce previous, current and next event in the events list.
- **P**: anounce the path for the selected event.

## Installation

### Download the Game

1. [Download the game here](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/index.html/).
2. Extract the ZIP folder and run the game.
3. If prompted, apply updates. If updates break the mod, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/fclorenzo/pkreborn-access/issues).
4. When asked for special instructions, choose “Yes” and enter the password "blindstep" to enable in-game accessibility features.

### Install the Mod

1. Download the mod by going to [the latest release page](https://github.com/fclorenzo/pkreborn-access/releases/latest).
2. Locate the "assets" section.
3. Under that section, locate the file "pkreborn-access.rb" and click on it to download.
4. Finally, create a folder called "Mods" inside the "patch" folder of your game, usually something like "Reborn-xxx-windows>patch" (where "xxx" corresponds to your game version), and paste the file you just downloaded there.
