# Pokémon Reborn Access

V1.0.1

## Description

This is a mod to further enhance accessibility for blind players in the Pokémon Reborn game, designed to be played alongside the "blindstep" password. The mod is originally a fork of Malta 10's pathfinding mod.

Confirmed working with game version 19.6 on Windows and the NVDA screen reader: <https://www.nvaccess.org/download/>.

I will always try to keep the mod updated to work with the latest game version, but feedback about other platforms or game versions is welcome and encouraged!
