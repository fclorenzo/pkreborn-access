> **Keep the “Feature:” in the title, and add a short summary — like “Feature: Add sound feedback for walls”.**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
Describe the problem you're experiencing or trying to solve.  
Example: "I'm always frustrated when I can't tell if a wall is in front of me while using pathfinding."

**Describe the solution you’d like**  
Clearly explain the feature or change you’d like to see.  
Example: "It would be helpful if the mod announced when you bump into an obstacle."

**Describe alternatives you’ve considered**  
Mention other ideas or solutions you’ve thought about.  
Example: "Maybe instead of F6, the mod could use other keys for its functionality."

**Additional context**  
Include any other context, mockups, links, or gameplay situations that would help illustrate your idea.
