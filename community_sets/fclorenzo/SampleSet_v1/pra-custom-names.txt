# Pokémon Reborn Access - Custom Event Names
# This file allows you to provide custom, meaningful names for in-game events, as well as ignoring events and creating your own Points of Interest.
# The mod will automatically read this file when the game starts.
#
# --- FORMAT ---
# Each line must have 6 fields, separated by a semicolon (;).

# - You can also create entries in-game by pressing Shift+K on a selected event.
