Also guys, I think I found an issue with the pathfinder, at least in that area: it's not able to pathfind when, let's say, you have to surf more than one time to reach the selected event. For example, if you are in a little island, and to go to the event you selected, you have to go surfing to the next island, and from there you can surf to the selected event
Or maybe the surf pathfinding is not working when the event is too far away
Also surf pathfinding is not taking into account map barriers, like map limits and borders with other maps

I think we will need to check for dive spots too

Always put the message connection to regardless if getting map name was successful or not

shift+k should trigger event renaming
shift+p should be announcing event's coordinates
